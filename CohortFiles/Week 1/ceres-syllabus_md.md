## Grades

Your grade is made of the following components:

| Item                | Percentage | Description                                                     |

| Exercise Completion |        20% | Cumulative percentage of curriculum exercises completed         |
| Assessments         |        35% | Average performance on assessments (timed coding challenges)    |
| Attendance          |        25% | Attendance percentage                                           |

- Progress reports will be delivered every 4 weeks
- Multiple-choice quizzes will be taken at the end of every module
- Assessments will be taken approximately once per grading period (4 weeks)
- Exercise completion will be determined based on the work on your GitHub account
    - No credit will be given for misnamed files or repositories
    - No credit will be given for files that are not in the correct location
    - Only files on the master branch will be looked at (unless otherwise noted)

## Classroom Conduct

In general, you are expected to be respectful of the instructors, your peers,
and yourself.

**Do**

- Ask questions
- Collaborate with and help your peers
- Be curious and seek out new challenges
- Silence your cellphone
- Take breaks when you need them

**Don't**

- Engage in off-task activities during class time (YouTube, Netflix, news
  sites, gameing, social media, etc.)
- Call and text on your cellphone
- Discourage others
- Sleep in class

We ask that you leave the classroom to perform non-classroom related activities.

### Attendance

Class starts at 9:00 every morning. This doesn't mean you should show up at 9,
rather, you should be ready to begin at 9, meaning you should be present at
least 10 to 15 minutes prior in order to review the past day's material and
prepare for the current day.

- Arriving later than 9:00 counts as a tardy
- Arriving later than 9:15 counts as a half day absence
- Leaving before 4:45 counts as a half day absence
- Leaving before 5 counts as an early departure

If you are not going to be present for any reason, email instructors@codeup.com
to let us know.

#### Classroom Hours:

- Generally 9 to 5
- End early on Tuesdays
- Long lunch and lunchtime speakers on Thursdays

|     | Start | Lunch        | Stop |
|-----|-------|------------  |------|
| Mon | 9:00  | 12:30 - 1:30 | 5:00 |
| Tue | 9:00  | 12:30 - 1:30 | 4:00 |
| Wed | 9:00  | 12:30 - 1:30 | 5:00 |
| Thu | 9:00  | 12:00 - 1:30 | 5:00 |

## How to Get Help

The primary way to get your questions answered is by asking them in the
classroom during classroom hours both during lessons and during exercise time.
Instructors and student fellows will be available to help you.

Outside of classroom hours, email instructors@codeup.com for help with your
questions. When emailing for support, please be sure to include all instructors
in the email through the instructors@codeup.com list, as opposed to emailing an
individual instructor.

In addition, you may use HubSpot to schedule time with an
instructor during study hall hours (before or after class).

## Miscellaneous

### Seating Arrangement

Seating is assigned and will be changed at the instructors' discretion,
approximately every 3 weeks. If you have preferences for where you sit in the
classroom, email instructors@codeup.com to let us know.

### Teamwork / Collaboration

Development is not a solo activity. You will be expected to work collaboratively
with your classmates, both informally throughout the course, and formally, in
the form of pair and group projects.

You should communicate in a professional manner with your teammates;
for example, if you have to miss class during time designated for a group
project, you should notify both your teammates and instructors@codeup.com.

### Presentations / Code Demos

Throughout the course you might be called upon to demo and discuss your work to
the rest of the class.

Please keep in mind that the schedule below is tentative and subject to change,
