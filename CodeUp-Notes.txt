Pair up with your neighbor and take turns interviewing each other with the following questions:

  What draws you to coding and web development as a career?
  What are your greatest strengths? Weaknesses?
  How has your background helped prepare you for web development (technical and non-technical)?
  Describe your dream job in web development.
  What technologies interest you, web development/coding-related, and otherwise?
  What blogs and other news sites do you go to to get the latest info on technology?

MVP - Minium Viaable Product
Brendan Eich, founded javascript and co-founded Mozilla.
ECMA - European Computer Manufacturers Association

Good interview examples: 
  Sophies html/css/js analogy
    HTML is the structure of the house. 
    CSS is the design of the house (color of walls, where furniture is placed)
    Javascript is what you can do in the house (open windows, close doors)

  VCS - Version Control System
  Repository - Folder that we designated for git.
  Commits - Snapshots of time.
  Should push your work twice a day. Once at the end of the morning and once at the end of the day. 
    In real world, commit after making a small feature. Then commit to branch.

  Request inspector

CSS
  BOM - Box Object Model
  has a selector and a declaration.
    declarations use key value pairs.
  top, right, bottom, left
    positive values push, negative values pull.
  Flexbox is good for one-demensional layouts
    like in a navbar
  CSS Grid is better optimized when you want to have two-demensional layouts. 
  Foundation was an old css layout
  Grid-Area { [Row-start], [column-start], [row-end], [column-end]}
  CSS Grid is the most efficient way to produce a layout

JS
  cmd+option+j - Opens developer console.
  type cohersion - When you take one data type and convert it to another
    no type cohersion on boolean values
    convert to num
      +"2" = declares a string into a number
      number("2")
      parseInt("2")
      parseFloat("2")
    convert to string
      num.toString();
      4 + ""
  double quotes can be nested into single quotes.
  3 '\' will not output a string. (if wrapped in string)
    if you want to use 2 \'s you have to use 4 \'s.\
    ... or just use double quotes
  modulus - the 'remainder' operator
  double not (!!) - is used to invert boolean
  Order of operations for comparison operators:
    NOT 
    AND 
    OR
  ==  - is a conhersion, can convert data types
  === - is a strict operator also compares value and data type.
  != - is a comparison operator (not recommended to use) 'not equal to'
    2 != 2 // false, 2 is equal to 2 (TRUE), inverted because NOT. (FALSE)
  'typeof [primitive datatype]' - will display the type of data type. Does not have to be in function.
    Does not work in Node.
  "var = x, y, z" // declare multiple variables
  do not have to use var to create variable
    cannot create a variable that starts with a number
  post and pre increment operator
    post - increment is after the var (i++)
    pre - increment is before the var (++i)
  NaN === NaN // false, 'is this unknown value equal to this unknown value'
    isNaN() - Is this value 'not a number' ?
    isNaN(undefined + undefined) // true
    isNaN("2") // true, can be converted to a number so will be true
    isNaN("1234fasdfsdf") // true
  Name of strings, difference between litteral and variable
    "str" = string litteral
    str = variable
