Good interview examples: 
  Sophies html/css/js analogy
    HTML is the structure of the house. 
    CSS is the design of the house (color of walls, where furniture is placed)
    Javascript is what you can do in the house (open windows, close doors)

  VCS - Version Control System
  Repository - Folder that we designated for git.
  Commits - Snapshots of time.
  Should push your work twice a day. Once at the end of the morning and once at the end of the day. 
    In real world, commit after making a small feature. Then commit to branch.

    Show list of branches
      git branch
    merge branch with master
      git merge [branch name]

  Pull Request

  Hide keys on gh - (dont need to export or import, variable is created in global scope)
    add keys.js to .gitignore
    create variable and add token to the variable
    use script tags and include the keys file. (html style)
    use the variable name created in first step in location of where the key originally was

  show list of commits
    git log

  git merge master
    merges master to branch you are working on

IntelliJ
  cmd+shfit+a - spotlight for intellij
  cmd+option+t - brings up menu, 'surround with tag'
  cmd+option+L - Auto refactor code

HTML
  HTML - Provides Structure for Website
  Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language.
  Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.
    Examples: <form>, <table>, and <article>
    Non-Examples: <div> and <span>
  Void elements are self closing tags
    <br/>, <hr/>, <img/>
  Request inspector
    https://request-inspector.glitch.me/
  GET requests send passwords in url.
    Limited number of characters
  POST requests are good for sending a lot of data

CSS
  BOM - Box Object Model
  has a selector and a declaration.
    declarations use key value pairs.
  top, right, bottom, left
    positive values push, negative values pull.
  Flexbox is good for one-demensional layouts
    like in a navbar
  CSS Grid is better optimized when you want to have two-demensional layouts. 
  Foundation was an old css layout
  Grid-Area { [Row-start], [column-start], [row-end], [column-end]}
  CSS Grid is the most efficient way to produce a layout

JS
  cmd+option+j - Opens developer console.
  type cohersion - When you take one data type and convert it to another
    no type cohersion on boolean values
    convert to num
      +"2" = declares a string into a number
      number("2")
      parseInt("2")
      parseFloat("2")
    convert to string
      num.toString();
      4 + ""
  double quotes can be nested into single quotes.
  3 '\' will not output a string. (if wrapped in string)
    if you want to use 2 \'s you have to use 4 \'s.\
    ... or just use double quotes
  modulus - the 'remainder' operator
  double not (!!) - is used to invert boolean
  Order of operations for comparison operators:
    NOT 
    AND 
    OR
  ==  - is a conhersion, can convert data types
  === - is a strict operator also compares value and data type.
  != - is a comparison operator (not recommended to use) 'not equal to'
    2 != 2 // false, 2 is equal to 2 (TRUE), inverted because NOT. (FALSE)
  'typeof [primitive datatype]' - will display the type of data type. Does not have to be in function.
    Does not work in Node.
  "var = x, y, z" // declare multiple variables
  do not have to use var to create variable
    cannot create a variable that starts with a number
  post and pre increment operator
    post - increment is after the var (i++)
    pre - increment is before the var (++i)
  NaN === NaN // false, 'is this unknown value equal to this unknown value'
    isNaN() - Is this value 'not a number' ?
    isNaN(undefined + undefined) // true
    isNaN("2") // true, can be converted to a number so will be true
    isNaN("1234fasdfsdf") // true
  Name of strings, difference between litteral and variable
    "str" = string litteral
    str = variable
  Everything in Javascript is an object. 
    String is primitive type and converted to object at runtime. 
  str.toFixed(2) adds ".00" at the end of numeric string.
  Functions
    functions are like paragraphs. 
    group of instructions.
    way of containing one or more statements
    called first class citizens in javascript
    Parameter - is what will be passed into the function
    Argument - Value that is passed into the function, and treated how parameter of the function is used. 
    leave off parenthesis you are referring to the original definition of the function
      var dogSound = bark;    // Assigning the definition of the function
      var sound = bark();    // Assigning the value of the function
    Function declaration syntax - The normal way of defining functions
      function bark() { }
    Anonymous Function - function defined without a name.
      var bark = function() { };
      (function () { [code] })();
    IIFE - function that has a anonymous function wrapped in parenthesis and is immediately called
  Conditionals
    Ternary operator - more efficient
      var [varName] = (condition) ? [true action] : [else action];
    Switch statements
      can just do return, instead of adding break statements
      no agreed upon solution for best practice.
  Loops
    A way to repeat logic
      While Loop - Will run while a condition is true
      Do-While - Will run at least once, but same as while loop.
      For Loops - Designed to run a given number of times. 
        for (incrementor; condition; increment) { ...
        can use letters in a string to run a for loop.
    Can break from or skip loops through loops
      break - exits the loop goes to continuing code. Break you out of the loop.
      continue - skips the code under when condition is true but continues the loop. Will continue to run loop.
    for of loops - Loop through values
    for in loops - Loop through property names
  Arrays
    forEach loops are specific to arrays. 
      [arrName].forEach (function(element, index, array){
        [code]
      });
      Order is mandatory, Name is not for attributes of anonymous function.
  Object
    Method is a function associated with object.
    Attribute is a property associated with object.
  DOM
    Objects using getElementByClassName are added to an node list. An Nodelist is like an array list but its not an array. 
    Can use similar methods with nodelist as you would array. 
  Jquery
    use older versions of jquery to support older browsers
    e.target refers to the same target as this. is clear
    this - what it refers to depends on how it is used
    AJAX - Asynchonous Javascript Requests, same as FETCH method with vanilla
      https://ur/.json  - Adding '.json' shows json data
      https://hookbin.com/  - used for analysing requests. Returns {success:true}
      jqXHR - jQuery xml request
  ES6
    immutable - Strings are immutable, when you run functions on them they create a copy and don't alter the original string. 
    mutable - Mutable objects are objects where you run functions it runs changes on the numbers.
    Map, Filter, Reduce - All functions off of an array.
    Reduce - is an reduction algorithm
    Sets - are unique collections that only allow unique values
  Promises
    Used for making a request to RESTful API, downloading large assets, loading the document, timed actions, reading and writing to files. 
    Promises make code cleaner. 
    a value that represents a eventual value of an asynch action
    avoids callback hell
    (looks a lot like .done() and .fail() in jquery)
  Babel
    Transpile - converts es6 to es5. Going down. 
    Babel is a transpiler in js. 
    stuff in the curriculm is out of date
  Webpack
    Copy the webpack command from website. 
      install webpack-cli, not in the long command on the website.
    "webpack --mode=development" - makes it developer readable.
    webpack config file has to be named "webpack.babel.config.js"
    "webpack --watch" - automatically refreshes the page.
  imp vs require
    require - often used with service-side js. Not supported natievely client-side (in the browser)
    import - often used in front-end js. Part of the es6 spec but not yet supported natievely by browsers
    break into module
      you can image dropping into another proj
      too many related functions are cluttering up your index.js
      have sensitive data that may be ignored by version control
    uses dash seperated (spinal-case)
    module.exports
      all (multiple) exports are objects. Export them as objects
    export default
      use import statement.
Java
  Jar - Executable file in Java
  sb (justin's environmental variable) - command allows you to see compiled code in hex. (CAFE BABE)
  javap -c - Lets you see all the procedures
  Java Byte Code - is the compiled version of java code. (.class file).
  Runtime errors - break when you try to compile
  Compiling error - when ide shows you the error before you compile
  Cmd + click on a class will show whats in the class
    You cannot change the language
  %n creates new line
  have more control by using nextLine. 
    use next to grab things by spaces.

  Java Doc Comments
  String is not a primitive type in Java. 
    There are 8 primitive types in Java. 
      byte = 1 byte
      short = 2 bytes
      int = 4 bytes
  Theres no undefined in Java. Everything has to be defined. 
  If you declare a variable, Java sets a default value to these variables.
    int - 0
    bool - false
  Constants are defined with 'final' keyword. In JS it was 'const'
  Camel case is also called Pascal Case.
  Casting
    Converting one datatype to another
    Implicit casting 
      Widening - Smaller datatype into a larger one
      less to more
    Explicit casting
      Narrowing - Larger datatype into a smaller one.
        Double -> Float -> Long -> Int -> Short -> Byte
        more to less
      Be careful if you explicitly cast.
        Pouring water from bigger container into smaller container.
    Cannot convert string to integer
      cannot parse a name of a number into a number
      parsing is better for converting "3" to 3
  System.in inputs
    "Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);"
    have more control by using nextLine. 
      use next to grab things by spaces.

================================= THE X Y Z OF CREATING A DOM EXERCISE
If the user does x, y will change in z way.
x === click || keyboard input || hover || wait
y === any part(s) of the DOM
z === change CSS/Text/HTML of the given DOM nodes
================================= DOM ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST
___ I can quickly and confidently add jQuery to an HTML page.
___ I can quickly and confidently add event listeners to various DOM elements.
___ I can quickly and confidently add event listeners triggered by various event types.
___ I can quickly and confidently cause style changes to specific parts of the DOM.
___ I can quickly and confidently change the inner text and inner html of specific parts of the DOM.
___ I can use information in the DOM to change other information in the DOM
Remember, use of jQuery is NOT required to complete the DOM Manipulation Assessment but using jQuery will make the problems simpler to solve.
