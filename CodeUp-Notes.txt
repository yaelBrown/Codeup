Cognitive Overhead = easier
Shadowing (in the java certification test)
throws - error handling is responsiblity of the calling code
Java Bean - class that has private properties and only getters and setters

Alan Kay - Inventor of OOP
James Gosling - Inventor of Java

Methods are verbs and verb phrases.
  Use terminology to reduce cognitive overhead
Classes/Objects are our proper nouns like User, Transaction, Accounts, SupportRequest
properties on our objects are lil' nouns
interfaces allow us adverbs/adjectives

Pair up with your neighbor and take turns interviewing each other with the following questions:

  What draws you to coding and web development as a career?
  What are your greatest strengths? Weaknesses?
  How has your background helped prepare you for web development (technical and non-technical)?
  Describe your dream job in web development.
  What technologies interest you, web development/coding-related, and otherwise?
  What blogs and other news sites do you go to to get the latest info on technology?

    will help you label out your outputs.

HTML
  HTML - Provides Structure for Website
  Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language.
  Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.
    Examples: <form>, <table>, and <article>
    Non-Examples: <div> and <span>
  Void elements are self closing tags
    <br/>, <hr/>, <img/>
  Request inspector
    https://request-inspector.glitch.me/
  GET requests send passwords in url.
    Limited number of characters
  POST requests are good for sending a lot of data

CSS
  BOM - Box Object Model
  has a selector and a declaration.
    declarations use key value pairs.
  top, right, bottom, left
    positive values push, negative values pull.
  Flexbox is good for one-demensional layouts
    like in a navbar
  CSS Grid is better optimized when you want to have two-demensional layouts. 
  Foundation was an old css layout
  Grid-Area { [Row-start], [column-start], [row-end], [column-end]}
  CSS Grid is the most efficient way to produce a layout

JS
  cmd+option+j - Opens developer console.
  type cohersion - When you take one data type and convert it to another
    no type cohersion on boolean values
    convert to num
      +"2" = declares a string into a number
      number("2")
      parseInt("2")
      parseFloat("2")
    convert to string
      num.toString();
      4 + ""
  double quotes can be nested into single quotes.
  3 '\' will not output a string. (if wrapped in string)
    if you want to use 2 \'s you have to use 4 \'s.\
    ... or just use double quotes
  modulus - the 'remainder' operator
  double not (!!) - is used to invert boolean
  Order of operations for comparison operators:
    NOT 
    AND 
    OR
  ==  - is a conhersion, can convert data types
  === - is a strict operator also compares value and data type.
  != - is a comparison operator (not recommended to use) 'not equal to'
    2 != 2 // false, 2 is equal to 2 (TRUE), inverted because NOT. (FALSE)
  'typeof [primitive datatype]' - will display the type of data type. Does not have to be in function.
    Does not work in Node.
  "var = x, y, z" // declare multiple variables
  do not have to use var to create variable
    cannot create a variable that starts with a number
  post and pre increment operator
    post - increment is after the var (i++)
    pre - increment is before the var (++i)
  NaN === NaN // false, 'is this unknown value equal to this unknown value'
    isNaN() - Is this value 'not a number' ?
    isNaN(undefined + undefined) // true
    isNaN("2") // true, can be converted to a number so will be true
    isNaN("1234fasdfsdf") // true
  Name of strings, difference between litteral and variable
    "str" = string litteral
    str = variable
  Everything in Javascript is an object. 
    String is primitive type and converted to object at runtime. 
  str.toFixed(2) adds ".00" at the end of numeric string.
  Functions
    functions are like paragraphs. 
    group of instructions.
    way of containing one or more statements
    called first class citizens in javascript
    Parameter - is what will be passed into the function
    Argument - Value that is passed into the function, and treated how parameter of the function is used. 
    leave off parenthesis you are referring to the original definition of the function
      var dogSound = bark;    // Assigning the definition of the function
      var sound = bark();    // Assigning the value of the function
    Function declaration syntax - The normal way of defining functions
      function bark() { }
    Anonymous Function - function defined without a name.
      var bark = function() { };
      (function () { [code] })();
    IIFE - function that has a anonymous function wrapped in parenthesis and is immediately called
  Conditionals
    Ternary operator - more efficient
      var [varName] = (condition) ? [true action] : [else action];
    Switch statements
      can just do return, instead of adding break statements
      no agreed upon solution for best practice.
  Loops
    A way to repeat logic
      While Loop - Will run while a condition is true
      Do-While - Will run at least once, but same as while loop.
      For Loops - Designed to run a given number of times. 
        for (incrementor; condition; increment) { ...
        can use letters in a string to run a for loop.
    Can break from or skip loops through loops
      break - exits the loop goes to continuing code. Break you out of the loop.
      continue - skips the code under when condition is true but continues the loop. Will continue to run loop.
    for of loops - Loop through values
    for in loops - Loop through property names
  Arrays
    forEach loops are specific to arrays. 
      [arrName].forEach (function(element, index, array){
        [code]
      });
      Order is mandatory, Name is not for attributes of anonymous function.
  Object
    Method is a function associated with object.
    Attribute is a property associated with object.
  DOM
    Objects using getElementByClassName are added to an node list. An Nodelist is like an array list but its not an array. 
    Can use similar methods with nodelist as you would array. 
  Jquery
    use older versions of jquery to support older browsers
    e.target refers to the same target as this. is clear
    this - what it refers to depends on how it is used
    AJAX - Asynchonous Javascript Requests, same as FETCH method with vanilla
      https://ur/.json  - Adding '.json' shows json data
      https://hookbin.com/  - used for analysing requests. Returns {success:true}
      jqXHR - jQuery xml request
  ES6
    immutable - Strings are immutable, when you run functions on them they create a copy and don't alter the original string. 
    mutable - Mutable objects are objects where you run functions it runs changes on the numbers.
    Map, Filter, Reduce - All functions off of an array.
    Reduce - is an reduction algorithm
    Sets - are unique collections that only allow unique values
  Promises
    Used for making a request to RESTful API, downloading large assets, loading the document, timed actions, reading and writing to files. 
    Promises make code cleaner. 
    a value that represents a eventual value of an asynch action
    avoids callback hell
    (looks a lot like .done() and .fail() in jquery)
  Babel
    Transpile - converts es6 to es5. Going down. 
    Babel is a transpiler in js. 
    stuff in the curriculm is out of date
  Webpack
    Copy the webpack command from website. 
      install webpack-cli, not in the long command on the website.
    "webpack --mode=development" - makes it developer readable.
    webpack config file has to be named "webpack.babel.config.js"
    "webpack --watch" - automatically refreshes the page.
  imp vs require
    require - often used with service-side js. Not supported natievely client-side (in the browser)
    import - often used in front-end js. Part of the es6 spec but not yet supported natievely by browsers
    break into module
      you can image dropping into another proj
      too many related functions are cluttering up your index.js
      have sensitive data that may be ignored by version control
    uses dash seperated (spinal-case)
    module.exports
      all (multiple) exports are objects. Export them as objects
    export default
      use import statement.

Java
  Jar - Executable file in Java
  sb (justin's environmental variable) - command allows you to see compiled code in hex. (CAFE BABE)
  javap -c - Lets you see all the procedures
  Java Byte Code - is the compiled version of java code. (.class file).
  Runtime errors - break when you try to compile
  Compiling error - when ide shows you the error before you compile
  Cmd + click on a class will show whats in the class
    You cannot change the language
  %n creates new line
  have more control by using nextLine. 
    use next to grab things by spaces.

  Java Doc Comments
  String is not a primitive type in Java. 
    There are 8 primitive types in Java. 
      byte = 1 byte
      short = 2 bytes
      int = 4 bytes
  Theres no undefined in Java. Everything has to be defined. 
  If you declare a variable, Java sets a default value to these variables.
    int - 0
    bool - false
  Constants are defined with 'final' keyword. In JS it was 'const'
  Camel case is also called Pascal Case.
  @annotations - Help Java make compiling decisions. 
    With inheritance, it tells java (@override) to use a specific method. Instead of Java evaluating and making a decision. 
  Casting
    Converting one datatype to another
    Implicit casting 
      Widening - Smaller datatype into a larger one
      less to more
    Explicit casting
      Narrowing - Larger datatype into a smaller one.
        Double -> Float -> Long -> Int -> Short -> Byte
        more to less
      Be careful if you explicitly cast.
        Pouring water from bigger container into smaller container.
    Cannot convert string to integer
      cannot parse a name of a number into a number
      parsing is better for converting "3" to 3
  System.in inputs
    "Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);"
    have more control by using nextLine. 
      use next to grab things by spaces.
  Control Statements
    Java does not have '===' like javascript.
    Cannot compare strings. 
    To compare strings use '.equals()' method
      sysout("yael".equals("yael")) // true
    Can also use '.equalsIgnoreCase()'
      compares strings but ignores the case.
    Adding a ! in front of equals statement negates it
    Use byte as a iterator for a for-loop
      continue skips in for-loop. 
      break stop the for-loop.
    Can have nested if statements. 
  Strings
    Primitive types store what the variable is in memory.
    Strings in Java are immutable
      other methods does not 'mutate' the original value of String
    Strings are objects. 
    When java object is created it has a reference id in hex.
      only value that the variable name holds is the reference id.
    When you assign one obj to another, you are assigning the reference id to the new obj
    Double quote comparison, objs are automatically created
      sout("hello" == "hello") // true
    use .equalsTo() method to compare strings. (like previously stated)
    use valueOf to convert another datatype to a string
      String.valueOf([different data type])
  Methods
    Have the main method at the top. 
      YOu will have other methods defined in other classes. All within the same package.
    Can store values outside of the main method. 
    "class is a collection of methods being defined"
    Similar to webpack layout. 
    Overload
      Can use different data types for the same method.
    Recursion
      Improves the readability
      It's faster in some languages but not in Java. 
      StackOverflowError is when you run out of memory calling a function. (by calling it too many times or calling within its memory stack).
        Memory - Stacks and Heaps
  OOP
    Entities are things in real life you can represent as a Java object
    Properties in Math class are static. You can access them without having to instantiate a new Math class.
      In contrast to instance fields are static fields, those that belong to a class as a whole. Static fields are accessible through the class itself. In other words, they are accessible without creating an instance of the class.
    Instance object is an object you instantiate and has static properties and methods.
    When you modify the static value, you make changes to everyone who uses the static values
      most likely they were set for a reason
      really don't need to be changed
    Use 'handle' methods to hand certain things within a class
      change the access modifier to private
    Test your methods and parameters in a test class.
    "Try not to repeat yourself"
    "Seperate out your concerns"
  Inheritance - Take properties from parent class. (inherit them)
    The diamond problem
    Visibility Modifiers 4 types - Use private, unless you have a good reason not to.
      public
      protected
      private
      package private (no modifier)
  Polymorphism - means having many forms
    Create getters and setters everytime you create a new property
    Always create a constructor for every class you create
    Why would you use polymorphism? 
      To treat every single instance the same way. 
  Final - keyword prevents further inheritance
    Final on a method - prevents them from being overridden
    Final on a variable - prevents them from being reassigned
  Abstract classes - Some structure, but not have some shape or weight
    Hiding implementation details from the user
    serve as a superclass, but cannot be directly instantiated
    classes dont have a body.
    basically a rule set for subclasses.
    Abstract methods cannot fit into non-abstract classes.
  Interfaces 
    Most likely more interfaces than abstract claasses
    Interfaces are always public by default.
    Methods are always public by default.
    Actions that multiple classes could use (verbs)
    'An addition of what I can do'.
    Implement the interface you have to implement the methods. 
      'how am i being sassy'
      use @override annotations
    Can implement multiple interfaces. 
    actual implementation of the method, it has to be public.
      within the child, that implements the interface. 
  FileIO
    java.io - older package from the 90's
    java.nio - newer package since Java 7. 
  Dependencies
    Guava - Google Java Libraries
      https://github.com/google/guava/wiki
    Spring Framework uses Maven by default
    Gradle - uses JSON files
    Maven (Apache) - uses XML files
      Gives order and structure
    GroupID - Name of the packages
      Start with reverse of the name
      com.codeup.blog
    ArtifactID - Name of package
      blog
    POM.xml - Manager of the Application/Project.
      File you would have all the dependencies in
      POM - Project Object Model
      <dependencies> -> <dependency> ... </dependencies>
      Maven Compiler Version POM
        <properties>
        <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source>
        <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target>
        </properties>
  JUnit
    /Test/Java/ folder for tests
    Every test requires a method and every method requires an @annotation
    Have the build inside of the POM file
    Add imports
      import org.junit.Test;
      import static org.junit.Assert.*;
    assertEquals() is overloaded
      Use for primitive types
    For every assertEquals theres a assertNotEquals
    Click the test to run speciific test
    'Going from red', red is the failing test or something not existing. 
    Test something with nothing, zero, one, or many
    Easier to clean your room when you have less things in your room.
    Happy path, not so happy path, really bad path.
    Assert Methods (junit docs) - https://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.12/org/junit/Assert.html
    TDD is dynamic documentation
    Delta - is the margin of error.
      Some cases you don't want to check for exact value. 
      Rocket Science for example you would. 
      Data Science people will tell you that it's not a good idea. 
      Read Junit docs on delta.
        The delta value is indeed the "error" or "uncertainty" allowed in the comparison. Comparing floating point numbers is tricky -- exact equality is hard to come by in many cases.
        It's quite common for the delta to be much smaller than the actual values -- for no particular reason, I generally use 1e-8, and this works well.

================================= THE X Y Z OF CREATING A DOM EXERCISE
If the user does x, y will change in z way.
x === click || keyboard input || hover || wait
y === any part(s) of the DOM
z === change CSS/Text/HTML of the given DOM nodes
================================= DOM ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST
___ I can quickly and confidently add jQuery to an HTML page.
___ I can quickly and confidently add event listeners to various DOM elements.
___ I can quickly and confidently add event listeners triggered by various event types.
___ I can quickly and confidently cause style changes to specific parts of the DOM.
___ I can quickly and confidently change the inner text and inner html of specific parts of the DOM.
___ I can use information in the DOM to change other information in the DOM
Remember, use of jQuery is NOT required to complete the DOM Manipulation Assessment but using jQuery will make the problems simpler to solve.


Star Wars api


Java Inheritance conclusions so far...
- Java allows classes and objects to inherit properties and methods.
- Inheritance keeps similar classes from requiring duplicate code and organizes our classes into groups, subgroups, subsubgroups, etc.
- The subclass/child class can access all public properties and methods from its super/parent class.
- A subclass can have additional properties and methods that don't exist on the the super class.
- A class can only extend from one other direct parent.
- Classes can keep extending down into more and more specific classes:
 Person
  is extended by Employee
 Employee
  is extended by Engineer
 Engineer
  is exteded by JuniorEngineer
 etc.
