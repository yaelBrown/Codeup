# Guide to Database Design

#### Normalization

The process of "normalizing" a relational database design. Different levels of normalization are possible, each level further seperating concerns and abstracting data over multiple tables.

#### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) 

A way to visually describe the schema of a database and the relationships between tables.

#### One-to-One Relationship
- ***Definition:*** a relationship where one record on a table matches with one record on another table.
- ***Example:*** users and user_details
- ***Common strategy to implement:*** the owner table of the relationship should have a foreign key to the non-owner.

#### One-to-Many Relationship

- ***Definition:*** a relationship where one record on a table matches with several records on another table.
- ***Example:*** users and posts
- ***Common strategy to implement:*** the table on the many side should have a foreign key pointing to the single owner from the owning-side table.

#### Many-to-Many Relationship

- ***Definition:*** a relationship where one record on a table matches with several records on another table and a record on the other table matches with several records on the first table.
- ***Example:*** users and events
- ***Common strategy to implement:*** neither table should have a foreign key to the other and instead, an associative (join) table should be used to link the two together via two foreign key columns, each linking to a primary key of both tables in the many-to-many relationship.

## DB Design Conventions to Follow

1. All tables except associative tables should have a single primary key called id.

  ```
  users
    id
    username
    email
    password
  ```

2. All table cells must contain atomic data (a single cell cannot contain multiple values).
  
  ```
    users
      id
      username
      phone_numbers
                        
    1 | bob123| 2105554545, 2105556767, 2105553232 <--- AVOID THIS!
  ```


3. All columns within a single row should be independent from one another (if not, another table may be needed).

  ```
    users
      id
      name
      favorite_color_1
      favorite_color_2
  
      A better alternative...
  
    users           
      id
      name
  
    colors
      id
      name
  
    color_user
      color_id
      user_id
  ```

4. When duplicate values exist accross multiple rows, consider breaking out the column(s) into another table.

  ```
  users
      id
      username
      email
      password
      home_state

  1 | bob123 | bob@email.com | JKL3J2JHSURNZ931H | Texas
  2 | kev123 | kev@email.com | JKL3J2JHSURNZ931H | Texas <--- duplicate!
  3 | dan123 | dan@email.com | JKL3J2JHSURNZ931H | Arizona
  4 | mat123 | mat@email.com | JKL3J2JHSURNZ931H | Washington
  5 | rob123 | rob@email.com | JKL3J2JHSURNZ931H | Texas <--- duplicate!

  Consider a states table.
